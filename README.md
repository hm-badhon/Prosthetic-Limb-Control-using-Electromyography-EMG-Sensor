# Robotic Arm with EMG Sensor Control

## Overview

This project demonstrates a robotic arm controlled by an EMG (Electromyography) sensor. The system interprets muscle signals captured by the EMG sensor to control the movements of the robotic arm. This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and guidelines for contributors.
